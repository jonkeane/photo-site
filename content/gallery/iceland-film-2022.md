The first photo-centric trip where I brought along my Hasselblad. The process of slowing down and being more delibrate was both fun and relaxing. Iceland itself was a wonderful subject for film and came alive in magical ways similar to film itself. And fun anecdote: I was reminded of how noticeable and what a conversation piece the Hasselblad is (for good and for ill!). I ended up chatting with a German teenager via their mother (the teen was shy and didn't feel as comfortable in English) about what and why film even exists. All while trying to hold a neutral density filter in front of the lens (oops, forgot my bayonet adapter) and time a longish exposure to get some flowing water shots.
