This trip was part beach vacation and part city time in Santo Domingo. Most of these photos are from Santo Domingo. I didn't fully expect how many little nooks and crannies I would find. Some looked like they could be modern clubs abandoned (or just currently unoccupied?), others look like an office that was vacated in a hurry.
