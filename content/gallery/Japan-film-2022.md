In many ways this was another photocentric trip for me. Japan is truly amazing—it's hard to list the ways. But specifically as a photo subject it is so much fun. I brought a bunch of film on this trip and these are some shots from Tōkyō, Kanazawa, Tōjinbō, Kōya-san, and a few other places. The garden in Kanazawa was magical with the snow mixed with some green. Tōjinbō was also especially striking with cliffs and rock formations.
