I've wanted to go to Thailand for about as long as I've been traveling. But each time I started planning I got distracted by something else. So when I had some time, I finally planned a big trip. The wait and anticipation of what Thailand would be like did not disappoint. Bangkok was as busy as any large Asian city, Koh Samui and Chiang Mai both had their own charm that made me fall in love with the country. I took 15 rolls of film, and ended up shooting most of it — only a handful of frames were leftover when I got home. The night shots of Bangkok traffic are random, but I love the painted lines from vehicle lights — a little taste of the managed chaos of traffic in Bangkok.
