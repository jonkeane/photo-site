Iceland in 2025 was a big trip — three weeks in total. We drove the entire ring road, spending a few days both on the Snæfellsnes Peninsula and in the middle of the Golden Circle. And then a week on the Tröllaskagi in a lodge with friends. I went through 23 rolls of 120 film, here are a selection of my favorites.
