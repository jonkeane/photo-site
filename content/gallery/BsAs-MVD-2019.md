Buenos Aires and Montevideo lay across the Rio de la Plata from each other. Both share some history and geography — but each is distinct in its own way. Buenos Aires lives up to its reputation as the Paris of South America — grand boulevards lined by picturesque buildings for kilometers. Montevideo feels a bit like a smaller version, but is no less of a city and beguilingly interesting in its own right. Stretches of beaches, high rises and mid rises, and ever present people strolling, lounging, and chatting while sharing a cup (or 10) of yerba mate. Delicious coffee and food are scattered through out a city that I could (and did) stroll through for hours.
