Iceland is perplexing. The landscapes are so varied and the nature so interesting. It is a photographer's paradise — there are too many things to see and take photos of. It feels like in every corner there's a new composition or new burst of color or difference waiting for you. On this trip I did most of the Golden Cricle as well as Reykjavík, but I will be back to explore more.
