The sun rises in the east, throwing its light over the wonders of Japan first—well, almost first—thing every day. The light illuminates the modern and sprawling wonder of Tōkyō, the tradition and ancestral respect of Kyōto, and the love of nature and food in Hokkaidō, and the reverence of Fuji-san. Technology and tradition mingle in Japan. Whether it’s the towering skyscrapers of Tōkyō with the hustle and bustle of Shinjuku or the agricultural wonderland and and no-nonsense beauty of Hokkaidō.
