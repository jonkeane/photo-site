Traveling with a camera, I capture snippets of the world and life as they happen. These are some scenes that caught my eye, sometimes for color, sometimes for culture, sometimes for curiosity. Hopping from place to place. I get my mail in Chicago but I get my adventure wherever I can.  My photos are snippets of life that caught my eye, scenes that show common human values of respect for the past, reverence of beauty, and hope for the future. We may be different, but we are all the same.

Often an outsider, always an observer and learner, I seek out experiences that connect us and celebrate nature, beauty, and culture. Around the word, we all share the same values of respect for the past, reverence of beauty, and hope for the future.
